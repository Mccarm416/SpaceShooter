Space Shooter
-------------

**


The game starts by dropping the player right into the game. The player controls a ship and tries to collect pickups. The player can also fire projectiles (controlled by a cooldown timer) which will destroy an enemy it comes into contact with. The player has 3 lives and can increase their score by grabbing green/grey cargo crates to increase it. If the player hits an enemy 1 life is deducted. Once the player reaches 0 lives, the game is over and a screen displaying the current high score as well as a button to reset the screen are displayed.
